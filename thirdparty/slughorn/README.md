`slughorn` is modern C++20 library implementing the recent OSS release of the
"Slug" GPU vector graphics rendering technique by [Eric Lengyel](https://terathon.com/blog/).
It makes no assumptions about what graphics environment is being used (OpenGL,
Vulkan, WebGL, WebGPU, DirectX, etc) and instead focuses *only* on simplifying
the process of creating/ingesting vector data from various backends--or,
alternatively, by using an HTML "Canvas-like" API directly in code--so it can be
directly uploaded to the GPU as easily as possible. A backend is simply an
implementation that produces Bezier curves for `slughorn` to process to
facilitate drawing. Further code outside of `slughorn` draws the curves with a
graphics API like OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGL, WebGPU, Metal, DirectX or similar,
potentially using toolkits like but not limited to OSG / OpenSceneGraph or VSG /
VulkanSceneGraph. Companion projects ( https://github.com/AlphaPixel/osgSlug )
assist with this integration.

Furthermore, `slughorn` provides tools for traditional "offline asset"
processing (primarily in Python), as well as a [glTF](#)-compatible JSON file
format.

# Architecture

`slughorn` operates in two complementary modes. As a **first-class authoring tool**,
it provides a Canvas-like API for building vector content directly in code — shapes,
text, gradients, and composited layers — all flowing into the GPU atlas without any
intermediate library. As an **adapter**, it bridges existing vector ecosystems (Cairo,
Skia, Blend2D, NanoSVG, FreeType) into that same GPU-ready pipeline, letting you keep
your current authoring workflow while gaining resolution-independent,
perspective-correct GPU rendering. Most GPU vector renderers want to own the authoring;
`slughorn` is being developed to support *bringing your own*.

The divison is basically: `slughorn` is the "unified source of truth", providing
data and hints/constraints about **how** that data is used; your *frontend*
decides what **do** with it.

# Current Supported Backends

- FreeType
- NanoSVG (paths & gradients)
- Skia (paths only, stroke-to-path)
- Cairo (paths only)
- Blend2D (paths only, stroke-to-path)

In addition to the above backends, `slughorn` provides a "native" API for
authoring vector graphics inspired by the standard HTML `Canvas` element.

Adding support for other backends is generally as easy as using a single helper
class: `slughorn::CurveDecomposer`. If your vector data can be reduced into
simple quadratic Bezier curves, `slughorn` can make it render.

> Supporting *most* of the missing Skia/Cairo/Blend2D features (gradients,
> patterns, text, clipping/masking) is entirely **possible**, it just requires
> time/effort. As slughorn continues to evolve, so will those backends.

# Skia

## Compilation

cd ~/dev/skia
rm -rf out/Release
bin/gn gen out/Release
ninja -C out/Release skia
```

## Why Slug Instead of Skia's GPU Backend?

### What Skia Actually Does on the GPU

Skia has two GPU backends: **Ganesh** (the older one, OpenGL/Vulkan/Metal) and
**Graphite** (the newer one, designed for modern explicit APIs). Both work by:

1. **Tessellating** paths into triangles on the CPU (or via compute shaders)
2. Uploading those triangles to the GPU
3. Rendering with relatively simple shaders

The key word is *tessellation*; Skia converts your curves into triangle meshes.
This means:

- Quality is **resolution-dependent**; you have to choose a tessellation
  tolerance, and if you zoom in far enough you'll see faceting
- Every time the path **transforms** (scale, rotation, perspective), you either
  re-tessellate or accept quality loss
- **Perspective projection** of curves is fundamentally broken with
  tessellation; a cubic Bezier projected through a perspective matrix is no
  longer a cubic Bezier

### What Slug Does Differently

Slug evaluates the **exact curve equations per-fragment** in the shader. This
means:

- Quality is **resolution-independent**; zoom in infinitely, edges stay perfect
- Transforms are **free**; the vertex shader handles them, the fragment shader
  doesn't care
- **Perspective is correct**; because you're evaluating the curve at each
  pixel, not approximating it with triangles
- No CPU tessellation step; the atlas is built once and never rebuilt
  regardless of transform

### Comparison

| | Skia GPU | Slug |
|---|---|---|
| Edge quality at scale | Depends on tolerance | Perfect always |
| Perspective correctness | Approximate | Exact |
| CPU work per frame | Re-tessellate on change | Nothing |
| GPU fragment cost | Cheap (just triangles) | More expensive |
| Setup complexity | High (full GPU framework) | Moderate |
| OSG integration | Very difficult | Natural |

### OSG Integration Specifically

Getting Skia's GPU backend working inside OSG would be genuinely painful:

- Skia wants to **own the OpenGL context**; it manages its own state, its own
  FBOs, its own texture atlases. OSG also wants to own the context. Getting them
  to share without stomping each other's state is a known headache.
- Skia's GPU API is **not designed to be embedded**; it's designed to be the
  renderer, not a component of one.
- You'd essentially be running two renderers side by side and compositing, which
  introduces synchronization, blending, and depth buffer problems.

Slug, on the other hand, is just **a shader and two textures**; it slots into
OSG's existing pipeline as naturally as any other `osg::Program`.

### The Real Answer to "Are You Reinventing It?"

For **2D UI / document rendering at fixed resolution**; Skia is better. It's
battle-hardened, handles edge cases you haven't thought of yet, and the
tessellation quality is fine for screen-resolution work.

For **3D scene graph rendering with arbitrary transforms and perspective**,
Slug is genuinely superior. The moment you want text or shapes on a billboard, a
HUD, a curved surface, or viewed through a perspective camera, Skia's approach
starts showing cracks and Slug's approach shines.

Slug is solving a different problem that Skia deliberately doesn't address.
